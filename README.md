code explained.
my main activity xml uses a scrollview layout which allows the user to scroll on the screen. aswell as a vertical "linearlayout" and 4 edittext fields for input. This page also have 3 buttons for adding your song, viewing the details and your list, and also for exiting the app.

my second activity xml also has a scrollable view, has 3 functioning buttons and a textview field.

my kt's have parallel arrays, input validation, error handling, loops to display song and calculate the average rating and buttons to navigate between the two screens.
